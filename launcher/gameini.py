"""The game's own settings, nx2navi.ini in the game folder, for the few the launcher's Settings switch.

Read the way runtime/cfg.c reads the file: a UTF-8 byte order mark is skipped, lines starting with #, ; or [ are
not settings, a key is matched without regard to case and with or without its NX2NAVI_ prefix, a value in double
quotes loses them, an empty value leaves the setting as it was (its default, or an earlier line's value), and the last
line with a value wins. Sections do not matter to the game; a key the file does not have yet goes under its section,
as the game writes it.
A change rewrites only the line it touches, through a temporary file: the other lines keep their bytes (the byte
order mark, line ends, text that is not UTF-8). A file that exists but cannot be read is never rewritten, as
runtime/cfg.c cfg_save_to does not: rebuilding it from nothing would lose its lines.
